    <p style="font-size:20px;">The Image Gallery Paragraph allows you to organize and display galleries of photos throughout your site.Up to 30 images can be added to an Image Gallery.Clicking an image will open a shadow box that allows users to cycle through all the images at full scale. The Image Gallery includes an option for captions, and galleries can also be displayed with an optional headline, description, and button.The Image Gallery paragraph is separate from the Media Library. Due to this, you currently cannot add items from the media library into an image gallery and instead must upload them separately. However, you can still view a listing of all your gallery images by navigating to [your site url]/admin/content/media and filtering by the Type of Gallery Images. You can also edit captions by clicking Edit next to the related photo. Keep in mind that editing the caption here will reflect everywhere that the image has been added.
